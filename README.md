# Fall Detection Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains a diverse and comprehensive dataset for fall detection research. Falls pose a significant risk to elderly individuals, patients with neurological disorders, and disabled children, necessitating the development of real-time intelligent fall detection (FD) systems. To address the limitations in existing approaches and facilitate advancements in the field, we have curated a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 10,500 samples with corresponding annotations.

## Dataset Details

- **Sample Size**: Approximately 10,500 samples
- **Annotations**: Each sample is annotated to denote instances of falls and non-falls.
- **Diversity**: The dataset encompasses diverse environmental conditions and scenarios, facilitating robust real-time processing.
- **Format**: The dataset is provided in a structured format to enable easy integration with popular machine learning frameworks.

## Proposed Approach

In addition to curating the dataset, we have proposed enhancements to the YOLOv8s model for fall detection. Our approach includes the following key innovations:

1. **Comprehensive Dataset**: We introduced a large-scale dataset to facilitate robust training and evaluation of fall detection models in challenging and complex environments.
2. **Progressive Enhancements to YOLOv8s**: We integrated specialized focus modules in the backbone and a coordinate attention mechanism in the neck module of the YOLOv8s model to optimize feature extraction and improve spatial contexts for enhanced localization, particularly in complex scenes.
3. **Empirical Evaluation**: We conducted an extensive empirical evaluation to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over 13 state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation includes meticulous benchmarking and qualitative validation across varied environments.
